# Vibe-LLM: Best Practices for Enterprise-Grade AI Inference, RAG, and Knowledge Graph Systems

## Overview
This document outlines best practices for developing, deploying, and maintaining a modular, secure, and scalable AI inference server with support for vLLM, HuggingFace, IO Intelligence, RAG, and knowledge graph integration. It is intended for contributors, integrators, and AI agents interfacing with this system.

---

## 1. Unified Model & Agent Registry
- **Auto-discover** all models and agents from all providers (HuggingFace, IO Intelligence, etc.).
- **Store metadata**: provider, supported tasks, health, latency, RAG/graph support.
- **Deduplicate** and annotate entries for clarity.
- **Expose** `/v1/models` and `/v1/agents` endpoints for unified access.

## 2. Smart Routing & Model Selection
- **Route requests** to the best model/agent based on task, provider, health, and security.
- **Prefer local/vLLM** for sensitive or high-performance tasks.
- **Proxy all external calls** through vLLM for logging, filtering, and security.
- **Graceful fallback**: If a model/provider fails, degrade to the next best available option.

## 3. Secure Proxying (vLLM)
- **All external provider calls** must go through vLLM for:
  - Logging and observability
  - Input/output sanitization
  - Unified error handling
- **No direct client-to-external-provider communication** is allowed.

## 4. RAG & Knowledge Graph Integration
- **Integrate** with a RAG MCP server for crawling, chunking, embedding, and retrieval.
- **Support advanced RAG strategies**: contextual, hybrid, reranking, agentic, knowledge graph.
- **Expose endpoints/tools** for RAG and knowledge graph operations.
- **Allow configuration** of RAG strategies via environment/config.

## 5. Task-Aware Inference
- **Dynamically select** the correct inference method for each model/task (e.g., text_generation, conversational).
- **Extensible backend**: Easy to add new providers or tasks.

## 6. Enterprise Practices
- **Comprehensive logging** and error handling at all layers.
- **Input/output validation** and sanitization for all endpoints.
- **Observability**: Health checks, metrics, and tracing.
- **Security**: Principle of least privilege, secrets management, and regular dependency updates.

## 7. RAG/Knowledge Graph Best Practices
- **Use contextual embeddings** for high-precision retrieval.
- **Enable hybrid search** for robust results.
- **Leverage agentic RAG** for code example extraction.
- **Apply reranking** for improved relevance.
- **Integrate knowledge graph** for hallucination detection and code validation.

## 8. Collaboration & Contribution
- **Document all new endpoints, models, and agents.**
- **Write modular, testable code** with clear interfaces.
- **Add/Update tests** for all new features and bug fixes.
- **Review and update this document** as the system evolves.

---

## For AI Agents
- **Always use the `/v1/models` and `/v1/agents` endpoints** to discover available resources.
- **Specify the task and provider** when requesting inference for best results.
- **Handle errors gracefully** and implement retry/fallback logic.
- **Respect rate limits and security policies.**
