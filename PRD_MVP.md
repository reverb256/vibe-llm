# 📄 Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## 🎯 Product Name
**AI Code Router**

## 🧠 Vision
A smart, extensible AI router that dynamically selects the best language model or tool for coding tasks, enhances prompts with RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation), and integrates external tools like Context7. Designed to work seamlessly with IDEs like VS Code (via Continue.dev) or VOID IDE.

---

## 📌 Goals

| Goal | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 🧩 Smart Model Routing | Dynamically choose the best LLM based on task type, latency, accuracy, and cost |
| 🔍 RAG Integration | Use vector databases and web search to enrich prompts with relevant context |
| 🛠️ Tool Coordination | Integrate with external tools via MCP (e.g., Context7) for web search, shell commands, file access |
| 🧪 IDE Compatibility | Work with Continue.dev and VOID IDE out of the box |
| 💡 FOSS & Local First | Support open source models (Ollama, vLLM), local deployment, and easy customization |

---

## 🧱 Core Features

### 1. **Model Router**

  - **Context7**: Web browsing, shell commands, file system access
  - Custom tools (linting, testing, formatting)
- Enables agent-like behavior without full orchestration

### 4. **Task Classifier**
- Lightweight classifier using Phi-3 or DistilBERT
- Determines if request is for:
  - Code generation

# ✅ Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Definition

## 🧩 Scope

The **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)** should allow developers to:

1. Send a prompt from an IDE (e.g., Continue.dev)
2. Have the router:
   - Classify the task
   - Select the best model
   - Optionally retrieve context (from local DB or internet)
   - Return a generated response to the IDE

## 🧱 Key Components

| Component | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| FastAPI Backend | Accepts JSON input from IDE and returns LLM output |
| Task Classifier | Lightweight classifier to identify task type |
| Model Selector | Chooses the best model from config.yaml |

| Client Wrappers | For Ollama, OpenAI, HuggingFace, Inflection.ai |
| CLI Tool | To test the router independently |
| IDE Integration Guide | Instructions for Continue.dev and/or VOID IDE |

## 🧪 Success Criteria

| Criterion | Expected Outcome |
|----------|------------------|
| Prompt Sent | IDE sends a valid JSON payload |
| Task Classified | Router identifies task type correctly (most of the time) |
| Model Selected | Correct model is chosen based on config and tags |
| Response Returned | Valid text response sent back to IDE |
| RAG Enhances Prompt | If enabled, context improves output quality |
| Works Locally | Runs fully offline with local models |

## 📁 Deliverables

| Deliverable | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Folder Structure | Clear, modular layout |
| README.md | Installation and usage guide |

## 🚀 Next Steps

Would you like me to:

- Generate the **README.md**, **Dockerfile**, and **installation instructions**?
- Create a **setup.py** or **Makefile**?
- Add **logging**, **metrics**, or **caching**?

Let me know how you'd like to proceed — I'm happy to keep building this with you step by step.

Absolutely — great question! You're thinking like a **product owner + systems architect**, which is exactly what you need for building something truly useful and scalable.

Let’s now **level up** your AI Code Router to make it:

- 🧠 **Smarter**: Add self-orchestration, agent-style behavior
- 💡 **More IDE-aware**: Understand context from VS Code / VOID (e.g., current file, selection, workspace)
- 🔁 **Self-improving**: Learn from feedback and performance
- 🔒 **Secure & Configurable**: Per-user settings, safe execution

---

# ✨ Enhancements for VS Code / VOID Integration

Your router should not just be a dumb proxy — it should **understand the coding context** in the IDE. Here's how we can improve that.

## 1. **IDE Context Awareness**
Currently, most LLM integrations only get raw prompts. But with Continue.dev or VOID IDE, you can send:

- 📄 Current file content
- 🧩 Selected code snippet
- 🗂️ File path / language mode
- 📚 Workspace structure
- 🛠️ Language server info (e.g., diagnostics)

### What This Enables:
- Better prompt engineering: “Fix this function in `utils.py`”
- Smarter RAG: Only search documentation relevant to the file
- Contextual refactoring: Understand variable scope before renaming

> ✅ **Action**: Update Continue.dev config or VOID plugin to include more context in requests.

---

## 2. **Agent-Style Self-Orchestration**

Right now, the router is reactive: receives a request, routes it, returns a result.

But if you want **truly powerful automation**, you can add **agent capabilities** like:

### 🔄 Loops:
- Try → evaluate → retry until success
- E.g., "Refactor this module" → generate diff → apply → test → repeat if broken

### 🧭 Planning:
- Break down complex tasks into subtasks
- E.g., "Build a Flask API" → plan files → create models → write routes → test

### 🧠 Memory:
- Store previous interactions for better continuity
- Use ChromaDB or Redis to remember user preferences, past refactorings, etc.

### 🤖 Tool Coordination:
- Chain multiple tools:
  - Search web → generate code → lint → format → run tests → deploy

> ✅ **Action**: Integrate an agent framework like **LangChain**, **AutoGPT**, or **CrewAI** as an optional layer.

---

## 3. **Robustness Improvements**

Here are several ways to make your system more reliable and production-ready:

| Feature | Benefit |
|--------|---------|
| 🧪 Prompt Templates | Standardize inputs for consistency |
| 📊 Performance Metrics | Track latency, accuracy, cost per model |
| 📦 Caching | Save responses for similar queries |
| 🔄 Fallback Models | If one model fails, try another |
| 🔁 Retry Logic | For transient errors (e.g., API timeouts) |
| 📈 Telemetry | See which models/tools work best |
| 🛡️ Rate Limiting | Prevent abuse of cloud APIs |
| 🔐 Safe Execution | Sandboxed shell commands, file access limits |

> ✅ **Action**: Add logging, metrics, caching, and fallback logic in core/router.py and utils/

---

## 4. **Security & Privacy**

If you’re deploying this in a team or enterprise setting:

| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 🔏 Local-Only Mode | No external API calls |
| 🗝️ Role-Based Access | Admin vs developer permissions |
| 🧽 Sanitization | Clean input/output to avoid prompt injection |
| 📁 Workspace Isolation | Keep different projects separate |
| 📦 Secure Defaults | Disable internet search unless explicitly enabled |

> ✅ **Action**: Add a security layer in api/main.py and config/

---

## 5. **Extensibility / Plugin System**

Make it easy for others (or yourself) to extend the system:

| Feature | Example |
|--------|---------|
| 🧩 Plugin Architecture | Add new tools without modifying core |
| 🧱 Model Plugins | Support new LLM providers easily |
| 🧰 Tool Plugins | New MCP integrations (e.g., GitHub Actions, Slack) |
| 🎨 Themeable UI | If you add a dashboard later |

> ✅ **Action**: Design a plugin interface under `/plugins`

---

## 6. **Dashboard & Monitoring (Optional but Powerful)**

Add a simple frontend to monitor:

- Which models are used most
- Response time over time
- Cost tracking
- Top task types
- Most common RAG sources

You can use:
- Streamlit
- FastAPI + React
- Grafana + Prometheus for metrics

---

# 🧠 Can It Self-Orchestrate?

Yes — and here’s how:

## 🔄 Basic Self-Orchestration Strategy

```python
def orchestrate(task):
    steps = plan(task)
    results = []

    for step in steps:
        tool = select_tool(step.type)
        result = tool.execute(step.prompt)
        results.append(result)

        if not validate(result):
            retry_or_switch_model()

    return compile_results(results)
```

### Example: “Fix all bugs in this function”

1. 🧠 Classify as debugging
2. 📚 Retrieve docs about linter rules
3. 🔍 Use Context7 to find similar issues online
4. 🧪 Run local linter
5. 🤖 Generate fix using Codellama
6. 🧪 Apply and re-lint
7. ✅ Return final version
